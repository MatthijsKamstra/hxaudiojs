## Inspired by audio.js


I was inspired by the works of Anthony Kolber: [audio.js](http://kolber.github.io/audiojs/).  
But after a closer look it could use an update:

- no need for flash anymore ([support of audio element](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio))
- using flat design (make css simpler)
- no need for a initialize script (wait for DOM an just do it)
- use [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) (Haxe is awesome! One codebase, many targets, no platform specific code.)
- it hasn't been touched in 2 years
