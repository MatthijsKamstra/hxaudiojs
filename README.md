## Inspired by audio.js

I was inspired by the works of Anthony Kolber: [audio.js](http://kolber.github.io/audiojs/).  
But after a closer look it could use an update:

- no need for flash anymore ([support of audio element](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio))
- using flat design (make css simpler)
- no need for a initialize script (wait for DOM and just do it)
- use [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) (Haxe is awesome! One codebase, many targets, no platform specific code.)
- it hasn't been touched in 2 years


###Installation


1. Put `hxaudio.js` and `hxaudio.gif` in the same folder.

```
/hxaudiojs
	/hxadio.js
	/hxaudio.gif
```
3. Include the audio.js file:

```
<script src="/hxaudiojs/hxaudio.js"></script>
```

2. Then you can use `<audio>` wherever you like in your HTML:

```
<audio src="/mp3/juicy.mp3" preload="auto" />
```


###Examples
